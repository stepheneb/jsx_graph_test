This is a sample sproutcore app testing the embedding of a JSXGraph component

The file: jsxgraph-onefile.js combines all the JSXGraph javascript files into 
one but it is not compressed to make tracing execution in Firebug practical.

This JSXGraph code was pulled from the head of their subversion tree: 

  https://jsxgraph.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jsxgraph

I created the file by adding this at line 86 of tools/makeDistrib.py in the JSXGraph codebase:

  fout = open('jsxgraph-onefile.js','w')
  fout.write(jstxt)
  fout.close()
